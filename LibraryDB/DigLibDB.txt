When you are connected to a network, you can share resources on your\ncomputer such as documents, programs, printers, modems and use other resources from other\ncomputer. The key idea of a Network is that users need equal access to resources such as data,\nbut they do not necessarily have to have equal computing power.\nLANs, WANs and ‘Client Server” concepts are perhaps the most important trend in modern\ncomputing.\nThere are two types of Networks\n&amp;#61623; LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)\n&amp;#61623; WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN)\nLOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)\nDefinition: A network of computers located in a single building or an a single site.\nA LAN may also include a Bridge which is a connection to another similar LAN and a Gateway\nwhich is a connection to a different types of network outside the LAN.\nWIDE AREA NETWORS (WANs)\n- Network on a number of sites, perhaps on a wide geographical scale.\n- WANs often use minicomputers or mainframe as the “pump” that keep the data messages\ncirculating, whereas shorter distance LANs normally use PCs for thin task.\nAirlines are a typical WAN network.\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN LANs AND WANs\n- The geographical area covered by WANs network is greater, not limited to a single building or\nsite.\n- WANs will send data over telecommunication links, and so will need MODEMS. LANs uses\ndirect cables only for transmitting data.\n- WANs will often use a lager computer a larger computer as a file serve.', 'news1162.jpg', ''),
